# Toll Calculator

A C# console application for calculating vehicle toll fees based on
Swedish congestion tax rules.

## Features

- Calculate toll fees per vehicle based on time of day

- Handles Swedish public holidays and weekends (toll free)

- Sliding 60 minute window — only most expensive fee per hour charged
- Daily maximum limit of 60 SEK per vehicle
- Fee free vehicles (Bus)
- Detailed fee breakdown per toll entry

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `TollCalculator.sln` in Visual Studio
3. Set `TollCalculator` as startup project
4. Press F5

## Project Structure

- `TollCalculator/` - Main application
  - `Models/` - Vehicle and toll entry classes
  - `Services/` - Calculation and holiday logic

- `TollCalculator.Tests/` - Unit tests

## Design Decisions

- `Vehicle` is abstract — a plain vehicle is never instantiated

- Toll free rules live in `TollCalculatorService`, not in vehicle
  classes — toll rules are a government concern, not a vehicle concern

- `SwedishHolidayService` is a pure calendar utility with no
  knowledge of toll rules — Single Responsibility Principle
- Swedish holidays calculated without third party dependencies
- Fee schedule defined as a static table in `TollCalculatorService`
  — easy to maintain and extend
- `VehicleRegistry` acts as a vehicle lookup — mirrors real world
  where toll sensors only register a license plate
